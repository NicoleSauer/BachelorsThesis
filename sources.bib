The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8, the object of this memo. UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values. This memo obsoletes and replaces RFC 2279.},

  abstract        = {Instant messaging (IM) systems can be considered the most frequently used applications in mobile social networks. Nowadays, people are becoming increasingly concerned about data security and privacy protection with IM applications. Therefore, a comprehensive enhanced secure IM scheme was proposed in this paper, which is based on the elliptic curve cryptosystem and the advanced encryption standard algorithm. An offline key agreement process between users was designed under the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption by updating the ephemeral key periodically. The proposed scheme supports denial of replaying attack and denial of forgery attack by utilizing timestamps and the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm. It supports multiple types of messages (such as document and multimedia messages) and prevents privacy leakage by storing sent and received messages with ciphertext. We proved the security of the proposed scheme under the elliptic curve discrete logarithm assumption and the CDH assumption. The comparison results of the proposed scheme with other schemes and the results of an experiment show that it is a comprehensive secure scheme with high security and good practicability.practicability.},

In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of an intermediate node that acts as a communication relay. This specification defines a protocol, called "Traversal Using Relays around NAT" (TURN), that allows the host to control the operation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using the relay. TURN differs from other relay control protocols in that it allows a client to communicate with multiple peers using a single relay address. The TURN protocol was designed to be used as part of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) approach to NAT traversal, though it can also be used without ICE.

However, these hot spots are vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks due to the broadcast nature of wireless communication. It does not require specialized hardware or particularly high level of experience to render 802.11 networks inoperable through DoS attacks. Standard off-the-shelf equipment is sufficient for a malicious station to disrupt the service between access points and stations. In this paper we present a systematic survey of DoS attacks, which exploits MAC and physical layer vulnerabilities of 802.11 networks. Available countermeasures against DoS attacks are discussed and compared. Future research directions and open issues are also discussed.}

abstract          = {Although there are several special features in block-chain technology such as machine trust, traceability, and security, high energy consumption remains an issue in broadening the applications of block-chain technology. Some researchers proposed the use of proof of stake (PoS) mechanism rather than proof of work (PoW) mechanism to reduce energy consumption of block-chain. However, because PoS cannot guarantee fairness, mixed consensus mechanisms could be a solution and has been adopted in many studies. This paper aims to evaluate the performances of PoW, PoS and mixed consensus mechanisms from three aspects: energy consumption, fairness, and reliability. An agent-based model of a typical block-chain system equipped with different consensus mechanisms is created in NetLogo. This model simulates and evaluates the performances of different consensus mechanisms in the block-chain system.}

  abstract        = {Large-scale peer-to-peer systems face security threats from faulty or hostile remote computing elements. To resist these threats, many such systems employ redundancy. However, if a single faulty entity can present multiple identities, it can control a substantial fraction of the system, thereby undermining this redundancy. One approach to preventing these ``Sybil attacks'' is to have a trusted agency certify identities. This paper shows that, without a logically centralized authority, Sybil attacks are always possible except under extreme and unrealistic assumptions of resource parity and coordination among entities.},

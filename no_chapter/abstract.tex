\chapter*{Abstract}

This bachelor's thesis introduces the development of an innovative Peer-to-Peer Instant Messaging protocol, leveraging a combination of Kademlia and Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE). The primary focus lies in creating a decentralized, robust Peer-to-Peer communication protocol that operates independently of central servers.

Participant authentication is achieved through public keys securely stored in the Ethereum blockchain. This blockchain-based authentication ensures a trustworthy identity verification process, with Ethereum's decentralized nature providing high security and tamper resistance.

A significant contribution of this work is the integration of Kademlia, a distributed Peer-to-Peer routing algorithm, and ICE, a mechanism for traversing network boundaries. This combination enables efficient and reliable P2P communication, minimizing reliance on central servers. The implementation is designed for high scalability and system robustness.

The presented solution not only offers a secure Peer-to-Peer communication environment but also underscores the importance of blockchain technology for authentication in decentralized systems. The developed protocol demonstrates how a combination of Ethereum, Kademlia, and ICE can form the foundation for a trusted and efficient Peer-to-Peer Instant Messaging infrastructure.
